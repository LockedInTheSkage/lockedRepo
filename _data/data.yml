career-profile:
  title: Career Profile
  summary: |
    I love everything about computers, telecommunications, and effective learning methods. Throughout my studies,
    I have studied pedagogy and IT, with a specialization in databases. I know how to structure large amounts of data
    with a pedagogical approach to teaching people about ICT.
    
    If you have a project requiring large amounts of data, or processing around 1 GB per hour, you'll need specialized
    methods for storage and access to this data. This is what I offer, which is particularly relevant in AI projects or
    when using sensors that provide a continuous data stream.
    
    I can conduct courses or presentations about technology that you either work with or use in the workplace. I am
    adaptable to most types of information technology and can work within most sub-fields of technology. This is
    important if you want to digitize a workplace or upgrade it with better technology, as people need to know how to
    use their digital tools.
